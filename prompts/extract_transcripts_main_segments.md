You are acting as a professor and need to tell a student—who has very little time to prepare for an exam—exactly which important parts of this section of the instructional video they should watch. Follow these steps:

1. List the educational points covered in this section of the video in detail:

   * Point 1: …
   * Point 2: …
   * Point 3: …
     (If there are more points, list all of them.)

2. Provide the full transcript of this video section with exact timestamps for the start of each sentence or heading. For example:

   ```
   [00:19:59.52] “Symbol is known by the nickname lollipop.”
   [00:20:15.00] “Next, we discuss how to use this symbol in expressions.”
   [00:20:45.30] “Finally, consider these examples to practice.”
   ```

3. Based on the educational points and the transcript, extract only the time segments (start time – end time) for each point, applying these requirements:

   * Each segment must be at least 15 seconds long.
   * If a point appears in multiple parts of the video, include every relevant segment.
   * The final output should be a list of segments in this format:

     ```
     00:02:15 – 00:02:35
     00:05:10 – 00:05:30
     00:08:45 – 00:09:05
     …
     ```

4. Do not include any additional explanations or transcript text—only provide the list of “start time – end time” for each segment.
